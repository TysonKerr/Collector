The alien will appear very quickly on either the left or right side of the habitat. Try to catch the alien by clicking the left arrow if the alien appears on the left side, or the right arrow if the alien appears on the right side.

off,0,user,"If you are successful in catching the alien, you will have a chance to examine the alien more carefully in its natural habitat. Try to study each alien and all its different features as best as you can, and also remember its unique habitat. The aliens may look very similar to each other, but they can differ on their features such as their eyes, mouth, antennae, arms, legs, and tail. Later on, you will have to remember each alien and where it likes to hang out. Let's practice the entire thing now. Again, use the left/right arrow keys to catch the alien. After you catch the alien, the alien will return to its habitat so you can study it for the later test!",AlienPractice,"""alien_min_delay"":3,""alien_max_delay"":4,""alien_appear_time"":0.5,""alien_catch_time"":1.5,""alien_final_study_time"":5,""feedback_time"":3,""left_key"":""ArrowLeft"",""right_key"":""ArrowRight""",Blocked
